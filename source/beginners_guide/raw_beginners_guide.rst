   Introduction
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

   I am creating this guide in response to misinformed/outdated guides and
   the criminal lack of content teaching people how to play this beautiful
   mission. My goal for this guide is to be the “one stop shop” for
   everything you need to learn about Antistasi community edition. I will
   try to keep this guide updated with each new patch.

   This guide is written exclusively for Antistasi community edition.
   Barbolanis version (the initial mission creator) and other freelance
   versions like Antistasi Plus may or may not be compatible with what I
   say in this guide. That said, I think the tactics and strategies used in
   this guide will likely work in other versions.

   This guide has been scrutinized and vetted by the developers and
   veterans of Antistasi Community edition.

What is Antistasi?
==================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   What is Antistasi?
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Antistasi is a guerrilla warfare simulator. As a rebel faction, you will
   start severely outnumbered and outgunned. BLUFOR is the main occupying
   force and will start owning most of the land. OPFOR is an invader who
   will start with very little land. The rebels are, well, rebels! As such
   they will start with no land at all.

Game modes
==========


.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Game modes
   ^^^^^^^^^^

   -  Rebel versus government versus invader - a three-way war. Everyone
      fights everyone

   -  Rebel versus government - no invaders, just you versus the
      government

   -  Rebels versus government and invaders - everyone is against you. The
      invaders and the government are coming for you.

   I recommend playing rebels versus government versus invaders first. It’s
   easier and allows you to fight two different factions.

How to set up a game
====================

.. card:: How to set up a game
   :class-header: header-2

   How to set up a game
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  To set up a game go to server browser -> host new session

   -  This mission is MP only.

   -  Set for LAN if you’d like to play alone. Set to internet if you’d
      like to play with friends.

   -  Select UPNP if playing with friends.

   -  You must port forward your router if you want to host a client
      (multiplayer) server. `Here <https://youtu.be/jzP1FGu82nw>`__ is a
      link on how.

   -  If you downloaded `the
      scenario <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1832638103>`__
      you should see “Antistasi community version” in the “set up a game”
      menu. Simply click to start the mission.

   -  Now select a role from the selection menu. And start

   -  Combat lifesavers are the only players capable of transfusing blood
      (ace only) and are the only role capable of healing downed players of
      fatal wounds.

   -  Engineers are the only players capable of repairing vehicles.

   -  The commander role has access to engineer and combat lifesaver
      abilities.

   -  All other roles like grenadier, automatic rifleman, and others are
      placeholder roles. You do not spawn with different equipment based
      off your role. You do however gain slight differences in your
      characters statistics. A marksman may have less visibility, for
      example.

Your parameters
===============

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Your parameters
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  To customize your game, click the parameters option on the top right
      of the role selection screen.

   -  You can only edit parameters on a mission that has not started.

   -  Your mission’s parameters will save.

   -  Here you can customize your game the way you want it.

   -  For example, I like having the ability to unlock launchers and
      explosives, so I turn that parameter on.

   -  If you want to start a new game, switch “load last save” from yes to
      no.

What mods should I use?
=======================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   What mods should I use?
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   I recommend the mod sets used on official servers. Of course, you can
   always use vanilla. No mods are needed for this mission.

Map Markers
===========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Map Markers
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   Main Article: :ref:`concept_mapmarkers`

   With that out of the way we can get into the mechanics of the mission.
   Map Markers, also known as strategic zones, are areas controlled by BLUFOR, OPFOR, or guerrillas.
   They all have a specific function and are guarded by their occupiers.
   It’s essential to understand how these strategic zones operate to be
   able to prioritize and plan appropriately. Note that garrisons may start
   off weak, but can be strengthened over time.

   -  **Airbases** are the headquarters of the enemy air force and main staging points for BLUFOR and
      OPFOR. You must be war level 3 to capture them. Taking an airbase provides you with an income of airstrike points;
      used for calling in airstrikes on the map.

   -  **Outposts** are fortifications garrisoned by the enemy. They inhibit
      guerrilla operations in the surrounding area and will send patrols
      and the local garrison to counter resistance actions. Outposts sometimes
      have radio towers inside them. Get more information on radio towers here.

   -  **Resources** give passive income to the occupier. Civilians work the resource. If they are killed the resource will be
      destroyed.

   -  **Factories** multiply the income you gain from resources. Civilians work the factory. If 4 of the workers are killed the
      factory will be considered destroyed.

   -  **Seaports** boost the HR you resource each income tick and also discount the cost of vehicles purchased at the HQ.

Towns
=====

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Towns
   ^^^^^

   Main Article: :ref:`concept_gainingandlosingcitysupport`

   -  Towns are where you will find the people and their vehicles to
      “\ *tactically acquire.”*

   -  Taking these towns gives you a small amount of money in the form of
      taxes and a steady income of HR to bolster your army.

   -  Towns are unique because they are not conquered through military
      means.

   -  **The only way to conquer towns is to conquer the hearts and minds of
      the people. This is done through the town support system.**

   -  The town will be guarded by police when the AI factions control it.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Town support system
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  The town support system is a simple system. **Having more people
         supporting your side than the occupiers, the town will flip to your
         side and start handing over their men and taxes to fight for
         freedom.**

      -  You can see each town’s support status by going to the map in HQ -
         selecting map info – and clicking on any town to see the population
         of the town and the percentage of people that support you or the
         enemy.

      -  **The town flips to the rebel’s side if more people support you than
         the enemy inside the town.**

Info Bar
========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Info Bar
   ^^^^^^^^

   At the top middle of your screen, you should see a range of statistics.
   This is what I refer to as your Info Bar.

   -  **HR** - **the number of men ready to volunteer for the good fight.**
      If you have 10 HR, you can recruit 10 men. You gain HR mainly from
      towns and missions

   -  **Personal Money** - money that is gained through completing missions
      and helping the resistance. You can only buy personal items like
      soldiers or a vehicle. This is capable of being transferred to the
      faction funds.

   -  **Faction money** - money only available to the commander. This can
      be used for almost everything including training and HQ command
      squads.

   -  **War level** - the enemy will gradually get better equipment with
      each war level. **War level increases as the resistance takes more
      territory.**

   -  **BLUFOR/OPFOR Aggression** - whenever you take hostile actions
      against a faction or civilians, that faction gains aggression. A
      faction with high aggression will attack more frequently and with
      more assets.

Your Headquarters
=================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Your Headquarters
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   HQ is your home. Here you will plan for missions, recruit soldiers,
   stash and retrieve equipment and more. Your HQ has many objects that
   facilitate various functions. We will go over these now.

   .. dropdown:: Petros
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      Petros is the leader of the resistance. Think of him as a banished political figure. He is the leader of the resistance and if he dies you will lose
      a considerable amount of HR and money. Also see: :ref:`concept_losingpetrospenalties`

      **HQ management**

      -  **Grab $100 from pool** - You can take money from the faction and put it in your wallet. Some things can only be bought with personal money so you will need to use this from time to time.
      -  **In game members list** - Displays all server members. Non server members cannot do certain things. Server admins can add members through the commander’s Y menu.
      -  **Manage garrisons** - Allows you to add or remove soldiers from friendly captured locations.
      -  **Move HQ to another zone** - There will be times where your base will be compromised. You will know this when you get a “defend Petros” mission. Note that they never learn about your HQ’s location, if you keep it there after the attack it will not make any difference.
      -  **Train troops** - Your troops suck at the beginning of game. You basically gave a villager a weapon and point them in the general direction of the enemy. You will need to train your men to turn them into soldiers. You do this through copious amounts of money. This is where the majority of money will go in the mid to late game. Also see: :ref:`concept_trainfia`
      -  **Rebuild assets** - In war, things blow up. In the process of taking a factory, you may have killed all the workers. In order to repair assets, hit this button. Clicking the button will take you to the map where you can choose to rebuild the zones you want. Repairing assets costs you 5000 per location.
      -  **Mission select** - Here you can request missions. More information about missions is available below.

   .. dropdown:: The Whiteboard / Map
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      **Game options**

      -  Here you can persistently save, **which I recommend you do every time
         you log off** as not doing so will mean you lose your progress since
         the last autosave.

      -  There are also minor tweaks you can make here like toggling music or
         selecting how many civilians can spawn at a time (list each option).

      **Map info**

      -  Map info is a useful tool for information. It tells you how many
         people support you or the occupiers, and **if you click on icons, it
         will tell you information about that zone.**

      -  Clicking on a town will show you the percentage of support for you
         versus the occupiers. It also tells you how many civilians the
         invaders have killed there.

      -  Clicking on any other zone will tell you its status combined with the
         garrison’s general strength. Consider attacking weakened or
         decimated zones over higher strength garrisons.

   .. dropdown:: The flag
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  The flag is where you recruit soldiers into your personal squad.

      -  **Remember that AI will only pick equipment that matches their role
         and is unlocked inside the arsenal.** Buying an automatic rifleman
         will not give you a man with an LMG if you do not have any LMGs
         unlocked.

   .. dropdown:: The Tent
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      **Sleep**

      -  Whenever you want to skip night-time, just press the “sleep 8 hours”
         function. Warning! Missions will auto fail if they exceed their time
         limit.

      **Make things go away**

      -  You can make the rain, the fog, or the nearby forest disappear using
         these options.

   .. dropdown:: The Arsenal
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  The arsenal is where all weapons and equipment are stored and
         retrieved from.

      -  You can create, save, and load loadouts from the arsenal for quick
         changes in equipment.

   .. dropdown:: The garage / vehicle arsenal
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      **Open garage**

      -  **Here is where you can ungarage all of your ground vehicles.**

      -  Inside the garage You can mount certain weapons to vehicles. For
         example, if you have a .50 Cal MG you may be able to mount it on the
         back of a truck.
      -  You can also customize your vehicle changing its attachments or painting it a different colour.

      **Heal nearby units**

      -  Hit this button to heal, refill stamina and allow all players and
         ungaraged vehicles to go undercover close to the red box.

      **Buy vehicle**

      -  Here you can buy civilian and military vehicles (vehicles covered in
         a later section).

      **Buy loot box**

      -  Provides you with a small box that can automatically collect loot
         within a small radius.

      -  These boxes can be loaded into the cargo of your truck.

      -  It makes looting much faster, and I highly recommend taking one with
         you everywhere you go.

      -  Loot box will only pick up locked items. If you already have unlocked
         M4 carbines it will not pick these weapons up. You can change this
         parameter in parameters

   .. dropdown:: Sources for the Garage
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      Open the garage and you will see three white squares in the bottom right
      of the screen. These white boxes indicate whether or not you have a
      fuel, ammo, or repair truck.

      -  You need these vehicles to repair, rearm and refuel your vehicles in
         the garage.

      -  For example, if you don’t have a repair vehicle, you will have to
         manually repair damaged vehicles with toolkits.

      -  You can find fuel trucks in towns. Just drive around and you will
         find a tanker.

      -  You can find the ammo truck on ammo convoy or steal and destroy ammo
         truck missions

      -  You can find a repair truck by destroying a radio tower, then waiting
         for a repair the radio tower mission.Alternatively, you can find on
         through a downed helicopter mission.

      *Take these trucks and store them in the garage*. I recommend locking
      them so no one takes them out.

Missions
========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Missions
   ^^^^^^^^

   Main Article: :ref:`mission_overview`

   There are several categories of missions all which have different tasks and rewards:

   - **Assassination Missions**
      - :ref:`mission_kill_the_officer`
      - :ref:`mission_kill_the_traitor`
      - :ref:`mission_specops`

      - :ref:`mission_refugees_evac`
   - **Spawned Dynamically**
      - :ref:`mission_defend_petros`
      - :ref:`mission_tower_rebuild_disrupt`
   - **Support missions**
      - :ref:`mission_city_supplies`

   **Convoy ambush tips**

   Most convoys are similar so I decided to make a one size fits all guide.

   -  Use mines and IEDs only on isolated roads where civilians will not drive.
   -  Set up entrenchments through the Y menu or using your E tool.
   -  Use roadblocks to slow down or immobilize the enemy.
   -  LMGs, grenade, and rocket launchers will help thin the numbers.
   -  Most convoys will have one or two light vehicles with 50.cal Mgs, and infantry trucks.
   -  Priorities are the 50. Cals, then the infantry trucks.
   -  Try and kill the infantry as they disembark.
   -  You won’t be able to loot soldiers killed inside destroyed vehicles. Better yet, spray them with an MG as they disembark.

Airstrike Points
================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Airstrike Points
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Main Article: :ref:`concept_airstrikes`

   -  Once you capture an airbase you will get a passive income of
      airstrike points.

   -  Each airstrike point allows one airstrike to be called in on a
      target.

   -  This is one of the biggest advantages of an airbase. Use airstrikes
      to weaken enemy outposts before launching an attack.

   -  Use cluster bombs for armour and incendiary and HE bombs for
      infantry.

   -  Incendiary bombs can kill crews without destroying the vehicle,
      allowing for recovery.

The Y menu
==========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   The Y menu
   ^^^^^^^^^^

   Press the “y” key to open this menu. You will use this menu for fast
   travel, managing AI, transferring and managing money, recruiting, and
   more.

   - **Fast Travel** - Depending on your parameters setting, you can fast travel to and from different zones provided there are no enemies within 500 meters of you. You can use fast travel to transport High Command squads and vehicles as well.

   - **Player and Money** - Here you can add or remove a player to/from the member list temporarily (until the server is restarted). Non server members do not have access to equipment that is not unlocked. Look at a player and press add server member to give them server membership. You can transfer your personal money to other players or the faction funds.

   - **Undercover On** - Use this setting to go undercoverif you are not being spotted by anyone and are not wearing suspicious equipment.

   - **Construct Here** - A number of objects used for cover and obstacles can be built through this menu. Only bunker options cost money and you must have an engineer in your squad or be an engineer to build bunkers.

   - **Garage vehicle** - Look at a vehicle while in a friendly location and press this button to send it to the garage.

   - **Unlock vehicle** - Allows other groups to use your vehicle.

   .. dropdown:: AI Management Menu
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      How to use: select the squad mate/HC squad you want to command, then
      select the command you want to do. For example, if I want only one of my
      squad mates to loot, I’d select them through the function keys then
      select “Auto Ream/loot.”

      - **Temp AI Control** - This option allows you to take direct control of an AI unit.
      - **Auto Rearm/Loot** - This command will allow your AI to upgrade their equipment from fallen enemies. If you use this command while they are in a vehicle, the AI will load the loot into that vehicle instead.
      - **Auto Heal** - This command allows your AI to heal themselves and others.
      - **Squad Sitrep** - Use for HC squads. They will tell you their combat status, how many of them are still alive, and if they are embarked or disembarked from their vehicle.
      - **Garrison units** - Use this command to add units to a garrison. This is especially useful when you have just taken a strategic zone and you need to defend from an enemy counterattack.
      - **Dismiss units** - Use this to dismiss/delete units. You will gain back the money for the vehicles but not for infantry/crew.
      - **Squad add vehicle** - Give HC squads vehicles they can use. This is especially useful for the INF team that is small enough to serve as a crew for armoured vehicles.
      - **Mount/ Dismount** - Forces HC squad units to mount/dismount their assigned vehicle.

   .. dropdown:: Commander menu
      :class-title: header-3-light

AI management and commanding
============================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   AI management and commanding the AI (micro managing)
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   AI management is essential to winning Antistasi, especially if you are
   alone. Managing AI is only half the battle, I recommend reviewing AI and
   how they work to understand how to fight and command AI effectively.

   .. dropdown:: Personal Squad management
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  First, learn the command system. Learning how to more intricately
         command our units allows us to apply our AI in different ways. You
         can learn how to command AI through the ARMA 3 tutorial.

      -  Be the spotter. Your AI will start with terrible spotting skill. The
         person in charge of spotting is the team leader, who has the highest
         spotting skill. But when you are in charge, you are the team leader.
         That is why you must spot for your AI. (\ ` + space while looking at
         target to spot) your AI will track enemies that you spot and fire
         with astonishing accuracy.

      -  AI are adept at crewing weapons regardless of their training. Put
         them on a 50.cal, or a mortar and they will fire with perfect
         accuracy. Use your AI to crew weapons and spot for them. You will be
         surprised at their effectiveness.

      -  Use Auto rearm/loot so your AI can get better gear in the field.

      -  While undercover, place your soldiers in cover and target enemies
         with each friendly soldier. Once their cover is blown, they will
         track and kill that target. This is great for ambushing.

      -  AI takes the attention off of you.

      -  Use the suppressive fire command to keep the AI pinned down. AI that
         are suppressed act irrationally and will be less accurate.

      -  Use AI as a distraction. For example, you can use a squad of AI to
         distract a local outpost while you destroy their radio tower.

   .. dropdown:: HC squad management
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  HC squads are primarily controlled through the Y menu and the map.

      -  To select HC squads, use CTRL + SPACE then select which squad you’d
         like to control

      -  On the map, you can only order move/attack orders.

      -  To instruct mortars to conduct a fire mission, have the unit selected
         then select SHIFT + Y.

      -  HC squads cannot be micromanaged to the degree that you can with your
         personal squad.

      -  Every squad will have its own squad leader who will spot for their
         squad mates.

      -  When you mount your squads, make sure that you place a move order on
         the road. AI are terrible at driving offroad.

      -  Disembark your squads away from the fight. The AI are slow to
         disembark even when getting shot at.

Storing equipment
=================

   Storing equipment
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   I will quickly go over how to store equipment in this game, because
   there are many ways to do it and sometimes you may have trouble storing
   a particular item.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Transfer vehicle cargo
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Anything you put inside your vehicle can be quickly and easily
         transferred into the arsenal by using the interaction menu while
         looking at the arsenal.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Storing loot boxes and arsenal boxes
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Sometimes you will find an ammo box filled with weapons and equipment
         that you can load onto a truck and take back to base.

      -  Obviously, you need a vehicle with sufficient cargo capacity to load
         the box and then move it back. Just put the vehicle close to the box
         then use the interaction menu to transfer the box to the back of the
         vehicle.

      -  Once you get to the base, the easiest way to transfer to the arsenal
         is unloading the box, opening the Y menu, then selecting “Put vehicle
         in garage.”

      -  Sometimes that might not work. Another way is with the box still
         loaded onto the truck, drive it as close as possible to the arsenal
         with the back of the truck closest to the arsenal as if you are
         unloading the box into the arsenal. Then select on the arsenal
         “transfer vehicle cargo to ammo box” this is buggy so it may take
         multiple tries but it does work.

      -  Lastly you may be able to unload the box, close to the arsenal and
         transfer vehicle cargo to ammo box.

      -  Hopefully with these three ways you will never have trouble storing
         the box. You can use this same method on loot boxes as well.

Looting
=======

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Looting
   ^^^^^^^

   -  Looting is a core part of Antistasi. You need to learn how to
      effectively and safely collect loot.
   -  For starters, always have a loot box. You can obtain loot boxes for
      $10 at the vehicle box.
   -  These loot boxes can be loaded into the back of the truck or inside
      the cargo of any vehicle using ace interact if there is not enough
      cargo capacity.
   -  Loot boxes allow you to collect loot with the press of a button.
   -  Simply look at the box and use the interaction menu to collect
      loot.
   -  The loot box only collects loot that has yet to be unlocked. I.E., it
      will not pick up the M4 if you already unlocked it inside the
      arsenal.
   -  You should only loot when you believe it is safe to do so.
   -  Use your vehicle as cover while looting, it will save your life. I
      like to drive in between unlooted enemies, loading and unloading the
      loot box as needed. This way I can retain the safety of the vehicle.
   -  You can also use the Auto Rearm/loot function AI in a vehicle to
      have them collect and load loot into the vehicle for you.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Managing your loot and arsenal
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  In Antistasi you start with limited gear. If you find enemy
         equipment, like an assault rifle for example, you can collect enough
         to eventually “unlock” that equipment.

      -  In order to unlock a weapon, you must have a certain amount of a
         weapon stored in your arsenal. This depends on your parameters. The
         default is 25.

      -  Explosives and Guided AT/AA Launchers cannot be unlocked by default,
         check parameters to change that.

      -  For ammunition, you must have a certain amount to unlock that
         ammunition. You can change this in parameters. The default is 25
         magazines of that weapon.

      -  If you’d like the ammo of a weapon to be automatically unlocked with
         the weapon, there is an option in parameters.

      -  Unlocking equipment allows your AI soldiers to use that equipment.
         For example, after unlocking an assault rifle, new soldiers will
         choose to carry that weapon instead of bolt-actions or SMGs. The
         equipment will also become infinite inside the arsenal.

      -  Obviously, we want ourselves and our soldiers to have the best
         equipment possible. So, we have to attempt to unlock as much
         equipment as possible.

      -  This means always looting the enemies you kill, at least in the early
         to mid-game. As you kill and loot, more equipment becomes unlocked in
         the arsenal and as a result you and your soldiers will become more
         lethal. But there are ways you can speed up this process.

      **There are essentially two schools of thought when it comes to
      equipment.**

      -  The first is to **never take any equipment you want unlocked until it
         is unlocked.** Choose to use worse weapons and equipment so that you
         may unlock that equipment faster. For example, I have 20 M4s **but I choose to use a FAL instead until I get 5 more M4s.**

      -  The second method is to take everything you want **as long as you believe it will make you more likely to come home alive.**

      Both methods have merit. I used to religiously use the first method   and died and failed more often, but when I DID succeed, I kept those weapons no matter what. I think it is more optimal to use what you have if it will make you more effective. Recently I started using equipment that was rare and I found I won more often. It’s really a risk versus reward analysis at the end of the day. Do what you think is optimal.

Loadouts
========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Loadouts
   ^^^^^^^^

   Please note there are no rules to loadouts, but if you are using the
   ACE mod, you have to account for medical supplies, ammo, weapons, and
   how that equipment will affect your weight. The heavier you are, the
   faster your stamina bar will deplete. This will have an adverse
   effect on your accuracy and speed.

   I assume you are using ACE for this tutorial.

   Here are some suggestions on loadouts you will likely need to pull
   quickly during emergencies. All of these loadouts will have 5 elastic
   bandages, 5 packing bandages, two 500m blood, 2 splints, 2 tourniquets
   and an entrenching tool. For most loadouts, I carry only two grenades and
   two smoke grenades.

   .. dropdown:: Starting loadout
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  Starting loadout, I go with a lot of grenades and pistol ammunition,
         I find the WW2 bolt action rifles you get at the start do not do
         enough damage.

      -  I spam grenades and don’t carry a primary to offset the weight of the
         grenades.

   .. dropdown:: AT and AA
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  There will be times you will need to grab an AT kit fast.

      -  I usually use an SMG or no primary with heavy AT weapons like the
         javelin or MAAWS because I have to account for the roughly 40-50
         pounds more I will carry.

      -  I carry as many extra rockets as I can carry in my backpack and I
         carry a bigger backpack.

      -  This will make me unbearably heavy so I will have to put some of the
         rockets in my truck to allow me to move around.

   .. dropdown:: MG
      :class-title: header-3-light
      :class-container: sd-card-3

      -  There are times where I want/ need to kill infantry fast. Enemies in
         Antistasi clump up a lot and makes machine gunners drool.

      -  I always put a 4x or higher scope, plenty of ammunition and usually I
         do not carry a secondary.

      -  I put ammo in my vehicle to offset the weight.

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Undercover and how to use it
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  In the early to mid-game, you can dress as a civilian and go
      undercover to recon and ambush enemy positions.

   -  This is an essential tool as it opens up many options for the
      resistance. This is the one advantage your opponent does not
      possess.

   -  In the top part of your screen, it will say (undercover: off/on) on
      coloured in green means you are undercover.

   -  In order to go undercover, you must be in civilian clothes and not
      wearing any military equipment. Being naked does not count either.
      Vests, NVG’s and helmets count as military equipment, but all
      backpacks are safe to wear.

   -  Press Y to open the Y menu and click “undercover on” to go
      undercover.

   -  Jumping into an unreported civilian vehicle will also put you
      undercover even if you are in full military gear.

   -  If you leave the truck near enemies while having military equipment
      on you will be “spotted” and lose your undercover status.

   -  Additionally, going off-road with any vehicle will get you spotted.
      If there are any enemies around Stay to the roads.

   -  Note that passing through checkpoints (the roadblocks you will see
      driving around) sometimes spots you. While this can happen at the
      lower levels of aggression and war level, the higher they become, the
      higher the chance of being spotted.

   -  If you are spotted and jump into a civilian vehicle that vehicle may
      become reported and will render it unable to give you undercover
      status. Try to re-enter your vehicle when no enemies are around.

   -  You can stash your weapons in your backpack and take it out when you
      need it. Understand the second you take out your weapon, even if no
      one sees you, you will be “spotted” and cannot go back undercover.

   -  Use enhanced movement and the E tool to obtain entrenched and
      elevated positions to ambush the enemy. They won’t shoot as long as
      you retain your undercover status

   -  Use your undercover status to recon enemy areas. Find out how many
      men they have, what equipment are they carrying, ETC.

   -  Use undercover to spot for your friendly artillery. You will become
      spotted if the enemy sees you even if you are just “spotting” so use
      cover and spot from a distance.

HQ placement
============

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   HQ placement
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

   -  Placing your HQ correctly is critical to the success of your
      resistance.

   -  You want your HQ to be both concealed and close enough to strategic
      zones for missions.

   -  Always place your HQ on or near the end of a road. You will want all
      of your vehicles to be on a road so you can go undercover. Going off
      road may get you spotted.

   -  Never place your HQ in between towns or other strategic zones. The
      enemy sends patrols in between zones and may spot your HQ.

   -  Place your HQ inside a compound and put Petros inside a building for
      added protection.

   -  Place your HQ within 4km of strategic zones so you can get missions.
      Any area 4km or more from your HQ will not be available for missions
      (distance can be changed through parameters)

Vehicles
========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Vehicles
   ^^^^^^^^

   -  There are only certain vehicles you can purchase through the red box.
      Civilian vehicles, and military vehicles.

   -  Civilian vehicles are vehicles you can purchase and go undercover
      when you enter them

   -  Military vehicles are vehicles that cannot go undercover and are
      sometimes armed. Weapon statics such as a mortar or HMG’s can also be
      bought.

   -  Off-roads are the backbone of the resistance. These can carry up to 6
      rebels, load supplies, loot, and arsenal boxes. And well, go offroad.
      To boot, they are a cheap 200 bucks! Use these liberally. Honestly,
      this is the only civilian vehicle you need.

   -  SPG-9s and SPG-9 mounted vehicles, this is your best purchasable
      equipment for dealing with enemy armour. The scopes can be
      complicated, but they allow you to fire from longer ranges and is
      very handy once you get the hang of it. The SPG also has HE shells,
      use these to terrorize infantry. Be warned however the SPG is a hit
      or a miss with tanks and IFVs (Infantry Fighting Vehicles).

   -  DSHK and the DSHK mounted vehicles are a great substitute to a M2
      HMMV. use these to out range enemy infantry. (700M or more) throw AI
      on it and target with binoculars for increased effect.

   -  ZU-23-2; your deadliest purchasable weapon and bane of all things air
      and infantry. Place these in your captured zones to annihilate enemy
      air attacks.

Taking a strategic point
========================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Taking a strategic point
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      What you will need
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Taking a strategic point in the early game is no easy challenge.

      -  The enemy’s vehicle arsenal is big and getting bigger every day so
         you will need at least this on hand to take and hold a point.

      -  You will need AT to eliminate Armor threats. NLAWs, MAAWS and JAVELIN
         launchers are the best launchers. The NLAWS and JAVELINS especially
         so because the missile will lock on to the target and should heavily
         damage when it hits.

      -  Armor tends to show up in the mid to late game more often than the
         early game, but you should have some on hand nonetheless.

      -  *You will need anti air when taking a strategic point.* Transport
         helicopters like little birds and chinooks can be taken down with 50.
         Cal MGs but for enemy attack helicopters and jets you will need
         proper AA launchers like the IGLA or STINGER missile launchers.

      -  From personal experience the most likely attack will be 1 or more
         helicopters filled with infantry (in the early game) but you should
         be ready for anything.

      -  You will also need a large amount of infantry on standby. Taking a
         point, you may be able to do alone, *but if you leave the strategic
         zone or more than a single enemy comes inside the strategic zone, the
         zone will flip to the enemy.*

      -  That is something you never want for reasons I'll explain later. That
         is why you will always want friendly infantry nearby to take and hold
         the point.

      -  I usually bring at least double the men the resource has. If they
         have 20, I bring 40. Even if my soldiers have body armour, helmets
         and rifles, they will not have AT launchers, LMGs, or other rare
         equipment and their training will definitely be inferior to the
         enemy. That is why I bring double at least.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Scouting your target
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Go to map info and check to see if the garrison is in a weakened
         state. *If its status is weakened or decimated it will have a
         smaller garrison and easier to attack.*

      -  You should also scout the point you will attack and plan ahead.

      -  Find out how many of them there are and what their equipment looks
         like.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Taking the point
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Ok, so you’ve scouted the target, you have double the men outside the
         zone ready to take the point on your command. You have both AA and AT
         assets ready to fight the counterattack. What now? Now you attack.

      -  *The real objective is from the point the fight first starts to
         finish it as fast as possible.*

      -  *The longer you wait, the more likely the enemy will continually send
         unmarked reinforced convoys or transport helicopters to replenish the
         garrison.*

      -  Once you flip the point by interacting with the flag, *you MUST hold
         it.* The enemy will send one counter attack and if you take it down,
         congrats the point is yours. *But, if the enemy takes the point with
         their counterattack, and you flip it back, then you will have to face
         another counter attack AFTER you finish off the previous counter
         attack.* That is often enough to overpower you and force a retreat.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      After you take the point
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Ensure you have a large garrison to protect the point. If you have
         any, you should place static weapons and allow the AI to use them in
         case an attack comes.

      -  In the later stages of the game, I always have a ZU in every other
         zone. That is expensive though.

      -  The enemy WILL attempt to take this point again, make sure you are
         there to keep that point.

Taking an airbase
=================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Taking an airbase
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   So, you have a few towns, resources, factories and outposts under your control, a good amount of HR, money, equipment and even some armour assets. What’s the next big step? Taking an airbase of course. Taking an airbase is your gateway to what I call the late game. It allows you to ungarage and use air assets, you have the chance to gain a couple armour and air assets, and you cement your hold on the region. It’s a HUGE power spike.

   But it is not for the faint of heart. This won’t be your usual outpost smash. Air Bases have multiple squads of infantry, MG towers, mortars and even stationary AA Armoured vehicles. There are no armour patrols. Only a stationary AA vehicle which can be anything.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      What you will need
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  You can take and hold an airbase in many ways, but three things you
         absolutely must have: AA, AT, and a ton of infantry. Mortars and
         armour helps too. I would not suggest using any air assets as the air
         bases usually have AA sites.

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Attacking and holding the airbase
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      -  You will want to start with killing the enemy mortar, armour and MG
         towers first.

      -  Javelins make short work of armour

      -  Mortars can do wonders against the infantry, mortars, and MG
         towers.

      -  Once you soften them up, it’s time to send in the infantry. Assist
         the infantry in killing off the remaining infantry and take the
         airbase.

   This is all easier said than done, it might be a process. It once took
   me an hour of dying, and sending waves of infantry to finally take it.
   But the ruthless amount of equipment and manpower it may take is all
   worth the reward. This is part of the victory conditions so either way,
   you need the air base.

Enemy AI behaviour
==================

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Enemy AI behaviour
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Many people who play Arma 3 don’t understand how the AI works. They
   complain of the AI being terminators. They never miss, they don’t see
   foliage, etc. this section will explain how the AI works and how to
   more effectively manipulate and win against them.

   -  *AI responds to suppression.* Enemy AI who are suppressed will react
      irrationally and their accuracy and spotting skill will decrease.
      Keeping steady fire on the enemy will give you an edge in combat.

   -  *AI do see foliage.* Large bushes and foliage that are larger than
      the player’s character hide the player. Bushes smaller than the
      character are inconsistent at concealment however.

   -  *AI can’t see through smoke.* The AI will not be able to see through
      smoke. However, the cloud of smoke must be fully formed to
      conceal.They may also fire through smoke because it was the last
      known position of the player, and they are attempting to suppress.

   -  *The AI does not care about visual camouflage.* It does not matter if
      you wear forested or arid camouflage clothing in a forested
      environment.

   -  *The AI will spot an enemy with a line of sight based on their
      camouflage coefficient number.* A sniper role will have a coefficient
      number of 0.8, making him harder to spot than a basic rifleman that
      has a coefficient number of 1.2. This camouflage coefficient number
      is affected by movement, noise, and stance of the player.

   -  Being prone and crouching will make you less visible to the AI.

   -  The AI will react to audible noises like sprinting close to them or
      firing. Walking slowly to an enemy may allow you to get the jump on
      them.

   -  Suppressed weapons reduce the range at which the AI can hear you
      firing from. They do not prevent the AI from hearing the shot
      altogether.

   -  Continually firing your weapon without pause, even with a suppressor
      will result in the AI looking for the source of the incoming fire and
      identify the source of the fire unless the attacker relocates.

   -  AI can hear you breathing when you are fatigued.

   -  *AI responds to movement.* The faster you move, the more likely it is
      the AI to see you.

   -  *Flashlights will make you more visible to the AI.* especially in low
      light environments.

   -  *AI use offset targeting.* They will become more accurate the longer
      they shoot at a stationary target. Keep moving in combat to avoid
      getting shot.

   -  *AI will attempt to advance and flank the enemy.* Keep moving to
      avoid being flanked by the enemy.

Support System
==============

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Support System
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Enemy squad leaders can call in support in various forms when they
   come under attack from either opposing force. The ability to call in
   supports CAN be transferred from a killed squad leader to the next
   person who controls the group. As the war level increases, more
   options to what the faction can call in opens up. There are more
   factors than just war level to what may be called in.

   Supports:

   -  Quick Reaction Force

   -  Mortars

   -  Generic airstrike

   -  Close Air Support

   -  Air Superiority Fighter

   -  155mm Artillery

   -  Gunship (Vanilla Only)

   -  Carpet Bomber (Unfair Param)

   -  SAM Site (Unfair Param

   -  Orbital Strike (Futuristic Param)

   Victory condition
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Main Article: :ref:`concept_winlossconditions`

   Now it’s time to understand how we win the game. You must own all
   airbases and more than 50% of the population of Altis must support your
   side. You can own all of the map. and still not win. you need to work to
   take airbases and win the hearts and minds of the people to win.

Walkthrough
===========

.. card::
   :class-header: header-2

   Walkthrough
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. card::
      :class-header: header-3-light
      :class-card: sd-card-3

      Early game
      ^^^^^^^^^^

      -  Your first priority is gear. You should not attempt to take and hold
         any zones until you have a rifle, body armour, and helmet unlocked.
         This could take 10-20 hours of your campaign.

      -  Start by killing the patrols scattered around towns and completing
         the easy missions (city supplies and kill the traitor)

      -  Missions should be your bread and butter until the earlier mentioned
         goal is accomplished.

      -  As you accrue better weapons and vehicles, attempt to tackle more
         difficult missions.

      -  Checkpoints are great ways of getting some gear, including a useful
         50.cal mounted vehicle.

      -  Use all available resources to take on greater odds. *Improvise adapt
         overcome.*

      -  Once you obtain placeable explosives like C4, you should work to
         destroy nearby radio towers. Destroying these radio towers will keep
         the enemy from brainwashing the people and allow you to more easily
         convert them.

      Mid game
      ^^^^^^^^

      -  Once the original goal is completed, it’s time to take a strategic
         zone (refer to taking a strategic zone section), take an outpost with
         a radio tower or a resource first. Garrison 20-30 soldiers for an
         adequate defence.

      -  Now that you have a zone under control expect frequent attacks
         depending on the aggression of the enemy factions. Defend against
         those attacks and scavenge their dead for equipment.

      -  Continue attacking zones only when you have the opportunity to. (You
         will need the vehicles, HR and money)

      -  Fortify your zones with static weapons, soldiers, and cover. This
         will allow you to stay on offense later in the game.

      -  As you gain more advanced AT options, attempt to capture enemy armour
         and turn it against them.

      -  Use roadblocks and observation posts to solidify your hold on an
         area. Observation posts can be used as fast travel points as long as
         they are 500 meters or more from an enemy (must change fast travel
         parameters for this to work).

      -  Use your excess money to train your soldiers. This will make them
         more comparable to the enemy’s hardened infantry.

      -  Once you have a surplus of soldiers, AA and AT assets, and hopefully
         armour it may be enough to take an airbase. Taking an airbase is no
         easy matter. Refer to taking an airbase section for more.

      -  You should attack an airbase only when you feel you’re ready. You
         need to recon the area and plan accordingly to win the day.

      -  Note that attacking an airbase does not have to succeed on the first
         attack. Launch multiple attacks and whittle them down.

      Late game
      ^^^^^^^^^

      -  Gaining an airbase is your way of knowing “we’re in the end game
         now”

      -  You should have gained armour and air assets, as well as a passive
         income of airstrike points from your airbase. Now it’s time to turn
         from a resistance to an army.

      -  Use your new assets to continue conquering Altis. Make liberal use of
         airstrikes and soldiers to overwhelm the enemy

      -  Use your armour assets carefully. You can be surprised at the
         accuracy of enemy AT. kill the AT assets first and focus on enemy
         armour.

      -  As you take from the government, so will the invaders. This will
         culminate in a power vacuum in between you and the invaders. The
         government will run out of vehicles and unable to counterattack or
         retaliate at all. I call this the collapse of the occupiers. Take
         advantage and take as much from the government as possible. It’s free
         real estate.

      -  Once the government is gone, it’s just you versus the invaders. The
         invaders have a full vehicle arsenal and are not tolerant with the
         local populace. Piss them offand they will destroy cities and kill
         civilians.

      -  Defend every city retaliation. If they kill 1/3\ :sup:`rd` of the
         population of the map you lose the game.

      -  Be prepared for massive attacks because of their full arsenal. Once I
         had to fight 5 jets all at once!

      -  Take airbases and continue to convert as much as possible to win the
         game. You need at least 51% of the population supporting you and all
         air bases to win the game.

      -  This is all a process. You will die. A lot. You will fail attacks.
         The way to win Antistasi is persistence. Keep trying until you win.
         Whittle down the enemy. Sometimes it’s a slog, but I know you can do
         it. Good luck commander!
