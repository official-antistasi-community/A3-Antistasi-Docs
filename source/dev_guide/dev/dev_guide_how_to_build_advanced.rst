===================================

   With VS code Arma Dev Extension
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - Install extension from `marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ole1986.arma-dev>`_
   - configure the extension from the Antistasi workspace by opening the command pallet :code:`Ctrl`/ :code:`âŒ˜` + :code:`Shift` + :code:`P` and running the :code:`Arma 3: configure` command
   - fill in the configuration :code:`.json` file something like this

   .. code-block:: json

      {
         "title": "A3 Antistasi",
         "name": "A3A",

      }

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - Run the command :code:`Extensions: Open Extension Folder` and navigate to :code:`ole1986.arma-dev-0.0.20 -> out -> helpers -> runArma.js -> ln 54` and add :code:`-debug` to the list

   .. rst-class:: code-block-3
   .. code-block:: js

      let args = [
             '2', '1', '0', '-exe', 'arma3_x64.exe',
             '-mod=' + clientMods.join(';'),
             '-nosplash',
             '-world empty',
             '-skipIntro',
             '-debug'
         ];

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - now run the :code:`Arma 3: Build` command, this will output into your build folder with packed addons (and signed if you have a key designated)
   - run the :code:`Arma 3: Toggle code live` command this will create symlinked folders in your arma directory for filepatching, allowing "live editing" of code, by editing the source files (dosnt include anything processed by the config.cpp)
   - run the :code:`Arma 3: Run client` or :code:`Arma 3: Run client (with logging)` command arma should start with everything ready for you, (the logging alternate will open the rpt thats created on arma launch)


With batch scripting
===================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2 sd-mt-3
   :class-header: header-2

   With batch scripting
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - This method allows you to "somewhat" easily sign your mod with a private key if you want to run your mod on a dedicated server with signature verification.
   - To use the following batch script, copy it into a text file and rename the extension to .bat
   - Make sure to change all of the marked paths to the relevant absolute paths.
   - You can remove the portions about filepatching, private key signing, and public key signing if those parts are not needed.
