   | This page lists a few more advanced methods for building the mod if you're looking for true workflow optimization, or if none of the previous methods worked for you.


With VS code Arma Dev Extension
===================================

   :class-card: sd-card-2 sd-mt-3
   :class-header: header-2

   With VS code Arma Dev Extension
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - Install extension from `marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ole1986.arma-dev>`_
   - configure the extension from the Antistasi workspace by opening the command pallet :code:`Ctrl`/ :code:`âŒ˜` + :code:`Shift` + :code:`P` and running the :code:`Arma 3: configure` command
   - fill in the configuration :code:`.json` file something like this

   .. rst-class:: code-block-3
   .. code-block:: json

      {
         "title": "A3 Antistasi",
         "name": "A3A",
         "author": "Official Antistasi dev team",
         "website": "https://antistasi.de/",
         "version": "2.5.4",
         "buildPath": "build",
         "privateKey": "", //add the path to a private bikey for signing when building
         "serverDirs": [],
         "serverUse32bit": false,
         "clientDirs": [ //should list all addons the mod provides

           ],
         "clientMods": [
            // Example:
      		// "!Workshop/@CBA_A3",
      		// "!Workshop/@ace",

      		// "!Workshop/@Extended Function Viewer",

      		// "!Workshop/@DUI - Squad Radar"
         ],
         "ftpConnection": {},
         "steamPath": "H:\\SteamLibrary" //arma 3 install steam library, arma 3 tools should be in the same folder
      }

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - Run the command :code:`Extensions: Open Extension Folder` and navigate to :code:`ole1986.arma-dev-0.0.20 -> out -> helpers -> runArma.js -> ln 54` and add :code:`-debug` to the list

   .. rst-class:: code-block-3
   .. code-block:: js

      let args = [
             '2', '1', '0', '-exe', 'arma3_x64.exe',
             '-mod=' + clientMods.join(';'),
             '-nosplash',
             '-world empty',
             '-skipIntro',
             '-debug'
         ];

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - now run the :code:`Arma 3: Build` command, this will output into your build folder with packed addons (and signed if you have a key designated)
   - run the :code:`Arma 3: Toggle code live` command this will create symlinked folders in your arma directory for filepatching, allowing "live editing" of code, by editing the source files (dosnt include anything processed by the config.cpp)
   - run the :code:`Arma 3: Run client` or :code:`Arma 3: Run client (with logging)` command arma should start with everything ready for you, (the logging alternate will open the rpt thats created on arma launch)


With batch scripting
===================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2 sd-mt-3
   :class-header: header-2

   With batch scripting
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - This method allows you to "somewhat" easily sign your mod with a private key if you want to run your mod on a dedicated server with signature verification.
   - To use the following batch script, copy it into a text file and rename the extension to .bat
   - Make sure to change all of the marked paths to the relevant absolute paths.
   - You can remove the portions about filepatching, private key signing, and public key signing if those parts are not needed.

   .. rst-class:: code-block-3
   .. code-block:: bat

      @echo off
      setlocal

      rem *******Edit these three to match local config*********
      set builderpath="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3 Tools\AddonBuilder\AddonBuilder.exe"
      set armapath="G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Arma 3"
      set keypath="C:\Projects\BISkeys\Antistasi__NAME__.biprivatekey"

      set sourcedir="%CD%\A3A\addons"
      set builddir="%CD%\build\@A3A\addons"
      set extraparams=-packonly -sign=%keypath%

      del /Q %builddir%\*.*
      for /F %%x in ('dir /A:D /B /D %sourcedir%') do (
         %builderpath% %sourcedir%\%%x %builddir% %extraparams% -prefix=x\A3A\addons\%%x
      )

      rem *******Create links to mod and file patching data*******
      rmdir %armapath%\@A3ALocal
      mklink /J %armapath%\@A3ALocal "%CD%\build\@A3A"
      rmdir %armapath%\x\A3A
      mklink /J %armapath%\x\A3A "%CD%\A3A"

      endlocal

With Arma 3 Tools
===================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2 sd-mt-3
   :class-header: header-2

   With Arma 3 Tools
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Note that this guide exists almost solely for reference; building the mod this way is extremely inefficient and should be automated with one of the previous methods.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3

      Packing
      ^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - Open :code:`Addon Builder` from :code:`Arma 3 Tools`
      - Click options
         - Add to :code:`List of files to copy directly` these file extensions; :code:`*.p3d;*.paa;*.hpp;*.sqf`
         - Click the three dots next to :code:`Path to project folder` and navigate to the repository's A3A folder
         - Add the prefix in the format :code:`x/A3A/{folder to build}`
         - Optionally add a path to a :code:`.biprivatekey` for signing, this allows you to leave key verification on for dedicated server testing
      - Back in the main window, add a source directory, this will be in turn each addon folder in :code:`repository -> A3A -> addons -> {folder to build}`
      - Add a destination folder, this would be for example: :code:`repository -> build -> @A3A -> addons`
      - Ensure for testing that it doesn't binarize the files
      - Now, simply press build and repeat for each folder in the :code:`A3A -> addons`

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3

      Running
      ^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - Copy the folder in your build directory to your arma 3 directory (or symbolic link it, recommended)
      - In the arma 3 launcher, under the :code:`Mods` tab, click :code:`... More` -> :code:`Add watched folder...` -> :code:`Add 'Arma 3' folder`. This will automatically add local mods in your arma directory to your mods list for easy loading.

Live editing
===================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2 sd-mt-3
   :class-header: header-2

   Live editing
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

   - Live editing is where you use an option known as "filepatching" to make changes in-game without having to restart the entire game. It is not essential for building, but can help optimize your workflow.
   - For live editing you need to create this folder structure in your arma 3 directory; :code:`x/A3A/addons`, and then create symbolic links from each folder in your repository :code:`A3A/addons` folder to the one in your arma directory.
   - Next you need to go in your ArmA 3 launchers :code:`Parameters` tab and under :code:`All Parameters`, in the :code:`Advanced` section, tick the parameter :code:`Enable File-Patching`, then under the section :code:`Author`, tick the parameter :code:`Debug Mode`. I recommend favoriting these two for ease of use later on.
   - Now when you start with the build loaded under the :code:`Mods` tab, it will start in Dev mode and allow for recompilation of functions on the go either by reloading the mission or by calling the function :code:`A3A_fnc_prepFunctions`.
