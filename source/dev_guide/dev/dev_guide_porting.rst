   There is a high chance that you are here because you would like to either port a map to be compatible with Antistasi or to set up Mod compatibility so you can play with new and fancy assets.
   PLEASE NOTE that both systems will change in the near future as we are currently converting Antistasi from a Mission to a Mod.
   Nevertheless, we will supply templates and such so you will be able to port maps and mods in the future as well.
