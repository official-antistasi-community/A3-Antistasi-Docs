   - Maintainer is the person/people who (mostly) knows how the current code works. People who contributed: Localisation; Refactors; Small bug; etcetera; fixes do not go here. The maintainer list is updated when the code has rewritten/overhauled by a new person/people and the previous maintainer(s) will not be able to assist in troubles concerning the current code.
   - Remove unused fields.
   - :code:`Public: Yes` means this function is not tied to a complex system but can be freely called by other code/debug console.
   - It is not necessary to specify exact :ref:`code/array structure <dev_code_contribution_standardVariables>` (just :code:`<CODE>` or :code:`<ARRAY>`). However, a specific structure makes it clear what is expected/returned.
   - It is not normal to have 10 arguments. The majority of humans can only `subitise <https://www.dictionary.com/browse/subitize>`_ ~5 items, use that as a guide.

Standardised Variable Types
============================================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2
   :class-header: header-2-light

   Standardised Variable Types
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Because SQF is a small dynamically typed scripting language, there is no default design in of structures and variable types. I have created this guideline to clear the confusion about how to express variable types for function. The following syntax design is inspired by C# Func<> delegates(Except that name/description is coming after the type).

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Simple Types
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <ARRAY> banList
         <BOOL> easyMode
         <CODE> crateFiller
         <CONFIG> uniformParent
         <CONTROL> vehicleBuyMenu
         <DISPLAY> currentPlayerMenu
         <GROUP> AIPatrol
         <LOCATION> village1
         <OBJECT> Petros
         <SCALAR> chanceOfSuccess
         <SCRIPT> waitForSleep
         <SIDE> invaders
         <STRING> plainMessage
         <TEXT> fancyText
         <NAMESPACE> storageLocation
         <DIARY_RECORD> howToGetStartedGuide
         <TASK> defendPetros
         <HASHMAP> vehicleEnums

         <NIL> Usually used when a function provides no meaningful return.
         <ANY> Accepts any type, including nil.
         <T> Generic Type
         <T#> Generic Type if multiple are required, substitute # with an integer.

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-direct

      These names are based on the return of :code:`typeName` engine command. Variable names/description go after the the . UPPERCASE capitalisation is not strictly required.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Variables in Arrays
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <ARRAY<STRING>> badList
         <ARRAY<SCALAR>> weightedSelectionValues

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-direct

      Arrays passed to functions are expected contain certain types. Just :code:`<ARRAY>` will not provide enough information.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Anonymous Structs
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <SCALAR,SCALAR,SCALAR> A position or vector.
         <ARRAY<SCALAR,SCALAR,SCALAR>> A list of positions or vectors

         <STRING,ANY> A key-value pair.
         <ARRAY<STRING,ANY>> A list of key-value pairs

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-direct

      Arrays can be used to pass around structured data. Such as a position, that has to maintain the same order and only 3 values. In this case :code:`<ARRAY<SCALAR>>` will not do.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Named Structs
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      Some structs are common enough that almost everyone working with SQF will know what they are. This can provide a great simplification. PascalCase capitalisation is not strictly required.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <PosATL> A 3D position of Type 'Position above terrain level'
         <PosAGL> A 3D position of Type 'Position above ground level'
         <PosASL> A 3D position of Type 'Position above sea level'
         <Vec3> A 3D position or vector
         <Pos2> A 2D position or vector, such as marker positions.
         <Vec2> A 2D position or vector, such as marker positions.

         <ARRAY<Pos3>> A list of positions or vectors

         <KeyPair> A key-value pair
         <ARRAY<KeyPair>> A list of key-value pairs

      Details about the different position system can be found in the `biki <https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Position>`_. The required position system should be mentioned in the header.

      Feel free to add common and strongly defined types here:

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

         - :code:`<Pos#>` A collection of scalars where # represents the number of dimensions: :code:`[4,2,0]`
         - :code:`<Vec#>` A collection of scalars where # represents the number of dimensions: :code:`[4,2,0]`
         - :code:`<KeyPair>` A key-value pair. Use in :code:`getVariable`, and :code:`hashMap getOrDefault x`: :code:`["keyName",someValueOfAnyType]`
         - :code:`<Map>` An unordered array of key-value pairs. Use in :code:`createHashMapFromArray`: :code:`[["key1",value1],["key2",value2]]`
         - :code:`<KeyPair<T>>` A key-value pair where all values are of the same defined type.
         - :code:`<Map<T>>` An unordered array of key-value pairs. Values' type are specified: :code:`[["key1",0.5],["key2",0.9]]`
         - :code:`<UnitLoadout>` https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Unit_Loadout_Array

      Code Params and Return
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-direct

      Passing code around as delegates is required event handlers and actions. Specifying the parameters and return of code will be useful in it's required in SQF function. In order to shorten and simplify, :code:`<>` may be omitted if it is not an unnamed struct. The following syntax is inspired by C# Func<> delegates as C++ delegates are a mess.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         _fnc_paired_selectRandom = {
             (_this apply {_x#0}) selectRandomWeighted (_this apply {_x#1});
         }

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-direct

      If we wanted to accept a matching param and return signature, it could be expressed as:

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <CODE<ARRAY<STRING,SCALAR>,STRING> A select random weighted function.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Generic Functions
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      The above function does not care what type the values are, as they are just selected at random out an array. However, the return type is linked to the the input type. The params are first and return value last. The following is inspired by C# generics.

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         _fnc_map_selectRandom = {
             selectRandom _this;  // Does not care what type the values are
         }

      If we wanted to accept a matching param and return signature, it could be expressed as:

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <CODE<Map<T>,KeyPair<T>> A select random weighted function that takes any value type.

      Sometimes multiple generic types may be required:

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         _fnc_swap = {
             param ["_var1","_var2"];
             [_var2,_var1];
         }

      If we wanted to accept a matching param and return signature, it could be expressed as:

      .. rst-class:: code-block-3
      .. code-block::

         <CODE<T1,T2,<T2,T1>> A select random weighted function that takes any value type.

   Languages and Localisation
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Getting started
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      Localisation in ARMA means the game will try to load the correct language for the version of the game it is currently using. By adding translations, or localisations to this project, we can make it easier for for all players to get involved and use this Mission.

      A technical overview of Localisation can be `found here <https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Stringtable.xml>`_.


   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Contributing to Localisation
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      see :ref:`dev_guide/dev/dev_guide_localization:translation-localization of antistasi via tolgee`



   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      For this example I will use the Version number of Antistasi, as this changes frequently and requires manual adjustment each release.

      .. code-block:: xml

          <Container>
            <Key ID="STR_antistasi_credits_generic_version_text">
              <Original>1.4c2.0</Original>
            </Key>
          </Container>

      **Key Setup**
      There are two main parts to setting up localisation, the KEY and the Text. From the example we can see the following information.

      - Key : STR_antistasi_credits_generic_version_text
      - Original : 1.4c2.0

      The Key is used to identify the text you wish to display in game. By default all Keys in Antistasi should follow a standard convention, using following pattern where possible.

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - Prefix: :code:`STR_antistasi_`
      - Area of code: :code:`credits_generic`
      - Item name: :code:`version`
      - Type: :code:`text`

      From this you can easily determine that this code belongs to "Antistasi", is used in the "Generic Credits" module and contains the "Version" "text".

      **Text Setup**

      The second part of localisation, is the text. This is the actual information which is going to be displayed to users, from the Stringtable when the variable is called.

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph-2

      When creating a new, or change an old KEY, it needs to contain :code:`<Original></Original>` as a minimum. The :code:`Original` tag implies the default value to be displayed for all game clients, if their default language is not found.

      Currently our version will display the following to all game clients, regardless of their language settings. Adding additional languages requires the use of a new tag containing the language you wish to use. For this example we will use English.

      Our version example is currently:

      .. code-block:: xml

         <Original>1.4c2.0</Original>

      Adding an English localisation can be done with:

      .. code-block:: xml

          <Container>
            <Key ID="STR_antistasi_credits_generic_version_text">
              <Original>1.4c2.0</Original>
              <English>1.4c2.0.6</English>
            </Key>
          </Container>

      **Note**: `There are a limited selection of supported languages for localisation <https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Stringtable.xml#Supported_languages>`_.

Reviewing Pull Requests
============================================================

.. card::
   :class-card: sd-card-2
   :class-header: header-2-light

   Reviewing Pull Requests
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The style of reviewing code is very different per person.
   However, here is an example for getting started:

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Overview
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      I take 7 skims (quickly reading and not paying much attention) over the code looking for these things:

      .. code-block:: markdown

         * [ ] Indentation & Headers
         * [ ] Naming Conventions & Grammar
         * [ ] Macros
         * [ ] Param & Call
         * [ ] Global Variables
         * [ ] Local Variables
         * [ ] Logic (Will take the longest)

      **Equipment**

      - I have lined paper or an Excel spreadsheet to take notes.
      - Coffee or Tea is a good review parter.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Indentation & Headers
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      - This only applies to new or rewritten functions.
      - Indentation must be in spaces. 4 spaces is normal. However, if there are a lot of indentation (Barbolani's if-else chaines), then less spaces are acceptable. I use Visual Studio Code to Check-Out the Pull-Request, then I search for the tab character so it will be highlighted.
      - Headers must attempt the :ref:`standard header <dev_code_contribution_standard_header>`.

      **Not all of the header information is necessary. The most important lines are:**

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - :code:`Author` (original author and people who might of helped him/her)
      - :code:`Arguments` & :code:`Return` Value (Does not need to be as specific as :code:`Standardised-Variable-Types`. For example just :code:`<ARRAY>` would be fine. All arguments in :code:`param` must be listed here.)
      - :code:`Environment` (This is important, if it uses :code:`sleep` it cannot be run from the debug console)

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Naming Conventions & Grammar
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - People should not name their variables :code:`_a`, :code:`_69`, :code:`_someUnrelatedName`, :code:`_bbv`, :code:`_bbc`. The variable name should describe what it holds.
      - Grammar is not important, and only matters when text is displayed to the player, using :code:`A3A_fnc_customHint`, :code:`systemChat` ect.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Macros
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      Macros are not common. When they are used, just check that they are correct and will not cause problems.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Param & Call
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      Double check that the arguments for :code:`call` match the :code:`param` in the function. Check that the function always returns the expected type.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Global Variables
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - All global variables created must be prefixed. :code:`banList` will not be accepted, it must be :code:`A3A_banList`.
      - Check that global variables are always created before they are used.
      - Tell the author if there are possible race-conditions. Usually when clients modify arrays and then broadcast with :code:`publicVariable` or :code:`setVariable [name,value,true]`

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Local Variables
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - All must be declare with :code:`private`.
      - Check that a local variable is not used in a :code:`spawn` as it will not be defined in that scope.

   .. card::
      :class-card: sd-card-3
      :class-header: header-3-light

      Logic
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      .. rst-class:: code-paragraph

      - No syntax errors.
      - No undefined edge-cases.
      - Does not need to be 100% optimised. But it cannot be slow when there is a better way to code a function. (Check nested :code:`findIf`, :code:`forEach`, :code:`forFrom`, multiple :code:`nearObject` ect.)
      - Make sure everthing works as expected.
